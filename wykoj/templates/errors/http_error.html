                Hello guys, welcome back to another chess tutorial. Yes, it is me, GM Vikram Rahul
                Abishek Pranav Rajesh. Today I will show you a simple yet effective chess trap that
                players of any rating will be guaranteed to fall for. It is a variation of the
                Tennison Gambit, and I will show you why it is so effective. We will start with a
                standard opening, king's pawn to e4. Black responds with the Scandinavian Defense,
                queen's pawn to d5. The natural move would be to capture black's pawn. However, in
                the Tennison Gambit we will sacrifice this pawn. We will play knight to f3. Black
                responds by capturing our pawn, attacking our knight. Now we will move our knight
                to f5, saving the piece and attacking black's pawn. To defend the hanging pawn,
                black plays knight to f6, bringing the piece to an active square. We will move our
                d pawn to d3. Black is already ahead in the material, and so they will accept the
                sacrifice. Now we will develop our bishop by capturing the pawn on d3. Now you have
                essentially won the game. Black plays pawn to h6 attacking the knight. We can move
                the bishop to g6 to check black. Black cannot retreat his king because the bishop
                is now attacking this entire corridor. Black once again has no choice but to
                capture with their king. Black's queen is now exposed after we sacrificed a knight
                and bishop. The next move is obvious. We can launch an RT-2PM2 Topol-M
                cold-launched three-stage solid-propellant silo-based intercontinental ballistic
                missile to attack black's remaining pieces. However if you are a beginner at chess,
                you can use an anti-tank guided missile instead. In this example, we will use the
                BGM-71 TOW anti-tank missile launched from an M3 Bradley Cavalry Fighting Vehicle
                tracked armored reconnaissance vehicle. Now watch very carefully as we maneuver our
                ATGM to an effective position that can control the board. As you can see, our
                attack was a success. White now has a material advantage and is ahead in the
                development of their pieces.
